       <p>Jason Thomas Mraz (/məˈræz/; born June 23, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. In 2002 he released his debut studio album, Waiting for My Rocket to Come, 
        which contained the single "The Remedy (I Won't Worry)" that reached
         number 4 on the US Billboard chart. <br><br>His second album, Mr. A-Z, released in 2005, peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 100,000 copies in the US. In 2008 Mraz released his third studio album, We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. 
         It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and was an international commercial success primarily
         due to the hit "I'm Yours". <br><br>The song peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving him his first top ten single, and spent a then-record 76 weeks on the Hot 100. His fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200, 
         his highest-charting album to date.<br><br>
         Mraz has won two Grammy Awards and received two additional nominations, and has also won two Teen Choice Awards, a People's Choice Award and the Hal David Songwriters Hall of Fame Award. He has earned Platinum and multi-Platinum certifications in over 20 countries, and has toured in North America,
         South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and parts 
         of Africa. As of July 2014 Mraz has sold over seven million albums,[5] and over 11.5 million downloaded singles.[6] His musical style, from rhythmic feeling to his use of nylon string guitars, has been heavily influenced by Brazilian music.
